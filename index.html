                     A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                was born on October 15, 1931, in

                Space Research Organisation, where he
                was project director of the SLV-III, the
                first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both designed and produced in India
                </li>

                <li>
                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname 
                “Missile Man".
                </li>

                <li>
                    Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                ballistic missile, which incorporated
                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in 1989.
                </li>

                minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                government with the rank of cabinet minister

                    His prominent role in
                    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                    solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the tests caused great concern
                    in the international community.
